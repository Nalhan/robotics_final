# robotics_final

Final project for my Robotics elective class. 
Objective was to set up a simulation in Matlab and implement some novel features. I chose to:
  * Create massless links that allow the robot's base to move around the environment
  * Implement PID control to make the robot try to track a goal state
  * Implement arbitrary pathing waypoints to test the tracking
  
Here is a youtube playlist of some of the simulation videos recorded during testing:
